                        <h2>DIY Electric Motorcycle</h2>
                        <p>I have always been interested in electric vehicular technology. After reading about recently discovered high powered supercapacitors, I decided to construct a hybrid
                        battery pack utilizing the large specific power of the super-capacitors in conjunction with the high energy density of traditional lithium ion batteries. In order to
                        test the hybrid technology, I constructed a motorcycle using a recycled Kawasaki Ninja 250 frame, a 48 volt 100 amp motor. In order to sustain the high current needed by
                        hybrid modules switching system, I had to construct driver circuits capable of handling load at peak power draw. In addition, the charging of the battery pack proved to by
                        problematic due to the super-capacitors unique design. All together, this project costs $2,500 payed out of pocket from the money generated from my Cisco internship. The
                        battery pack lasts 40 miles which is unique for the packs 2.4 kWhhr rating demonstrating the capabilities of my hybrid system.</p>

                        <h2>Cisco Internship</h2>
                        <p>In my senior year summer I worked at Cisco Systems in order to gain some work experience. During this internship I built a system to build environments
                            for developers on the Cisco Polaris team. The gist of my first project was to convert a lot of legacy developer tools to python which was the new system
                            that Cisco was using for its Polaris operating system. I converted most of these old scripts from .tcl and .sh files which are now being rendered mostly
                            obsolete. After finishing this project in much less time then my boss thought it would take me, I was assigned a different project on another team that dealt
                            with the actual builds of Polaris. Every time a build is run, my code analyzed and graphed different characteristics of the build and could even auto build
                            the system if enabled by the developers. Both tools are now currently in use at Cisco. </p>

                        <h2>Graphene Based Electrical Generator</h2>
                        <p>There is a lack of sustainable energy technologies which are efficient, and more importantly, cheap. In order to solve this problem, the unique topological and
                            electrical properties of graphene were used. First, a cheap method of synthesizing graphene was investigated, and the most efficient process involved the sonication
                            of graphite flake powder in a water-heptane interface. Next, a structure to hold the graphene was designed and 3D-printed using the four design requirements: scalability,
                            power output, shape, and cost. Finally, real world simulations in a saltwater tank were conducted, and results were measured using a LED bulb and a multimeter.
                            Multiple test configurations were run: electrodes covered, electrodes uncovered, and various speeds in both conditions. After recording the data from the tests,
                            it was clear that the voltage outputted was linearly proportional to the velocity of the fluid over the graphene plates. Also, the five graphene plates were able to
                            provide enough voltage to power a 3 volt LED bulb. The structure proved to be scalable with a reasonable cost of $14, fulfilling all four design requirements.

                            <p>fter researching several issues, our team discovered several primary issues with current upper exoskeleton limbs: cost, size, and manufacturing issues. The first issue,
                                cost, has long since been accepted by exoskeleton manufactures because of the exorbitant price of hydraulic actuators which permeate the industry. For example, the cost
                                of one relatively high powered hydraulic actuator is $115 for a 14" stroke actuator (contracting device). The next most important problem is size. The exoskeletons of
                                today are simply too big and cumbersome to fit under clothes and would not be ideal for a patient looking for a small exoskeleton to support his or her body. The next
                                biggest problem is manufacturing. All of today's exoskeletons require hundreds of man-hours to construct and fine tune to the operator's body. Such time is simply not
                                available if these went to the consumer market. That is why we have designed the innovative HyFlex: to solve these problems and successfully help people in need of medical
                                treatment.</p>
