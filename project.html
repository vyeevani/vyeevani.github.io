                        <h2>DIY Electric Motorcycle</h2>
                        <p>In order to get myself around I decided that I needed a car. Unfortunately my dad disagreed saying that a car was
                        completely unnecessary for a high schooler. I've always been one to skirt my parent's rules and decided that only way
                        I was going to get around not having a car was to have a motorcycle. But it couldn't just be any old motorcycle. It needed
                        to be futuristic. I'm not an automobile designer so just making it look cool wouldn't work out so I decided to try to
                        put super-capacitors in it to extend battery life and drastically improve the regenerative braking. In order to cut costs I
                        bought recycled batteries that used to be in server back-up battery packs. Over the period of the next several months I perfected the charging system as well as the motor controller
                        and have started building arduino modules to improve security. I am also in the process of assembling the super-capacitor's into the hybrid
                        modules and provide much more power to the battery packs during peak current draw. The specs of the bike are 40 miles of range and 60 miles per hour
                        top speed. Finally, the total cost of the entire motorcycle was around $2,500. </p>

                        <h2>Cisco Internship</h2>
                        <p>In my senior year summer I worked at Cisco Systems in order to gain some work experience. During this internship I built a system to build environments
                            for developers on the Cisco Polaris team. The gist of my first project was to convert a lot of legacy developer tools to python which was the new system
                            that Cisco was using for its Polaris operating system. I converted most of these old scripts from .tcl and .sh files which are now being rendered mostly
                            obsolete. After finishing this project in much less time then my boss thought it would take me I was assigned a different project on another team that dealt
                            with the actual builds of Polaris. Every time a build is run, my code analyzed and graphed different characteristics of the build and could even auto build
                            the system if enabled by the developers. Both tools are now currently in use at Cisco. </p>

                        <h2>Graphene Based Electrical Generator</h2>
                        <p>There is a lack of sustainable energy technologies which are efficient, and more importantly, cheap. In order to solve this problem, the unique topological and
                            electrical properties of graphene were used. First, a cheap method of synthesizing graphene was investigated, and the most efficient process involved the sonication
                            of graphite flake powder in a water-heptane interface. Next, a structure to hold the graphene was designed and 3D-printed using the four design requirements: scalability,
                            power output, shape, and cost. Finally, real world simulations in a saltwater tank were conducted, and results were measured using a LED bulb and a multimeter.
                            Multiple test configurations were run: electrodes covered, electrodes uncovered, and various speeds in both conditions. After recording the data from the tests,
                            it was clear that the voltage outputted was linearly proportional to the velocity of the fluid over the graphene plates. Also, the five graphene plates were able to
                            provide enough voltage to power a 3 volt LED bulb. The structure proved to be scalable with a reasonable cost of $14, fulfilling all four design requirements.

                            <p>fter researching several issues, our team discovered several primary issues with current upper exoskeleton limbs: cost, size, and manufacturing issues. The first issue,
                                cost, has long since been accepted by exoskeleton manufactures because of the exorbitant price of hydraulic actuators which permeate the industry. For example, the cost
                                of one relatively high powered hydraulic actuator is $115 for a 14" stroke actuator (contracting device). The next most important problem is size. The exoskeletons of
                                today are simply too big and cumbersome to fit under clothes and would not be ideal for a patient looking for a small exoskeleton to support his or her body. The next
                                biggest problem is manufacturing. All of today's exoskeletons require hundreds of man-hours to construct and fine tune to the operator's body. Such time is simply not
                                available if these went to the consumer market. That is why we have designed the innovative HyFlex: to solve these problems and successfully help people in need of medical
                                treatment.</p>
