yo. I'm vineeth. I've been on the vision pro team at apple for the past ~4 years. For the three years before that, I was working on building my own augmented reality headset at a company I started. Before that I was obsessed with building motorcycles.

I'm obviously interested in ar/vr. My primary focus in ar/vr while at apple is realtime computer vision. Before that, I had also focused on rendering and hardware. Recently, I've become much more interested in robotics and reinforcement learning.

I'm good at c, c++, swift, rust, verilog, scala (chisel). I avoid but am also good at python. I'm decently proficient at altium. I'm pretty bad at CAD but I suffer through it anyways.
